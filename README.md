# Assignment
* Find anything in your surrounding whose name starts with C, H, or M (in English).
* Put the thing on a flat surface: table, floor, etc.
* Take photos of the thing from four different perspectives: top right, top left, top rear, top front (you are free to specify the angle).
* Create a README.md file consisting of the thing's name and the four photos you have taken.

* The JavaScript application comprises the definition of vertices that embody the shape of the object photographed in the previous assignment: Select two of the four photos.
* The definition of vertex includes position (x, y) and color (r, g, b) as represented on the selected photos.
* The shape as shown on one of the selected photos is rendered on the left side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = -1.0 and X = 0.0 axes.
*  The shape as shown in another selected photo is rendered on the right side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = 0.0 and X = 1.0 axes.
* The rendering result on the right side of the Canvas is animated vertically, bouncing back between the top and the bottom walls of the Canvas, with a speed of 0.0xxx units, where xxx is the last three digits of the NRP.

 thank you :)

# Task 3 
Please continue your WebGL application on the same repository as the previous assignment (https://classroom.github.com/a/X2bMi7wC) with the following specifications: 

- [x] Create a 3D definition of the object being photographed in your very first assignment. 
- [x] Draw the object twice—on the left and on the right half of the canvas—with the two perspectives corresponding to the two photos selected in the previous assignment. 
- [x] Add a little cube in the center of canvas, right between the two objects.
- [ ] Set the cube to glow white and become a light source.
- [ ] Add an ambient effect with an intensity of 0.abc to both objects, where the value of abc is the last three digits of your Student ID plus 200.
- [ ] Add a diffuse effect to both objects.
- [ ] Add a plastic specular effect for the left object.
- [ ] Add a metal specular effect for the object on the right.
- [x] Set the cube so that it can be moved upward with the W key-button and downward with the S key-button.
- [ ] Set the camera to move leftward and rightward linearly (not orbitally) using the A and D key-buttons.
