# Assignment
* Find anything in your surrounding whose name starts with C, H, or M (in English).
* Put the thing on a flat surface: table, floor, etc.
* Take photos of the thing from four different perspectives: top right, top left, top rear, top front (you are free to specify the angle).
* Create a README.md file consisting of the thing's name and the four photos you have taken.

* The JavaScript application comprises the definition of vertices that embody the shape of the object photographed in the previous assignment: Select two of the four photos.
* The definition of vertex includes position (x, y) and color (r, g, b) as represented on the selected photos.
* The shape as shown on one of the selected photos is rendered on the left side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = -1.0 and X = 0.0 axes.
*  The shape as shown in another selected photo is rendered on the right side of the Canvas: Located in the clip space between X = 0.0 and X = 1.0 axes.
* The rendering result on the right side of the Canvas is animated vertically, bouncing back between the top and the bottom walls of the Canvas, with a speed of 0.0xxx units, where xxx is the last three digits of the NRP.
